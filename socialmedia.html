            <p>Social media awareness means understanding how social media affects us and the world around us. It's about
                realizing that what we do online can have consequences for ourselves and others. It's important because so
                many people use social media every day, and it can impact our lives in big ways.</p>
            <h1 class="heading">Why is Social Media Awareness Important?</h1>
            <img src="example-image.jpg" alt="Example Image" class="example-image">
            <p>In today's digital age, where social media platforms have become integral parts of our daily lives, social
                media awareness is more important than ever. Social media has transformed how we communicate, share
                information, and interact with the world around us. However, with this increased connectivity comes the need
                for heightened awareness about the impact of our online actions.</p>

            <p>First and foremost, social media awareness is crucial for protecting our privacy and security in an
                increasingly digital world. With the vast amount of personal information we share on social media
                platforms, from our photos and locations to our thoughts and opinions, it's essential to understand how
                this data can be used and potentially exploited by third parties. By being aware of privacy settings,
                online threats, and best practices for safeguarding our information, we can better protect ourselves from
                cyberattacks, identity theft, and other online risks.</p>
